# nx-ignore

This package is used on Vercel to ignore builds if a project is not affected.

## Usage

In the `Settings > Git` section on Vercel, use this script as `Ignored Build Step`.

```bash
npx nx-ignore <project-name>
```

### Options

- `--base` - Set a custom base SHA to compare changes (defaults to [`VERCEL_GIT_PREVIOUS_SHA`](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#system-environment-variables)).
- `--verbose` - Log more details information for debugging purposes

## How it works

The `nx-ignore` command uses Nx to determine whether the current commit affects the specified app. It exits with an error code (1) when the app is affected, which tells Vercel to continue the build, otherwise it exits successfully, which tells Vercel to cancel the build.
