## What is Nx?

ðŸ”Ž **Smart, Fast and Extensible Build System**

Nx is a smart, fast and extensible build system. It comes with first class monorepo support and powerful integrations.

### Best-in-Class Support for Monorepos

<strong>Nx</strong> provides distributed graph-based task execution and computation caching.

<strong>Nx</strong> is smart. It analyzes your workspace and figures out what can be affected by every code change.
That's why Nx doesn't rebuild and retest everything on every commit--<strong>it only rebuilds what is necessary</strong>
.

<strong>Nx</strong> partitions commands into a graph of smaller tasks. Nx then runs those tasks in parallel,
and <strong>it can even distribute them across multiple machines without any configuration</strong>.

<strong>Nx also uses a distributed computation cache.</strong> If someone has already built or tested similar code, Nx
will use their results to speed up the command for everyone else.

### Holistic Dev Experience Powered by an Advanced CLI and Editor Plugins

<strong>Nx</strong> helps scale your development from one team building one application to many teams building multiple
frontend and backend applications all in the same workspace. <strong >When using Nx, developers have a holistic dev
experience powered by an advanced CLI</strong > (with editor plugins), capabilities for controlled code sharing and
consistent code generation.

### Rich Plugin Ecosystem

<strong>Nx</strong> is an open platform with plugins for many modern tools and frameworks. It has support for
TypeScript, React, Angular, Cypress, Jest, Prettier, Nest.js, Next.js, Storybook, Ionic among others. With Nx, you get a
consistent dev experience regardless of the tools used.
